        board: The board state.
        blank_pos: The (y, x)-coord of the blank tile.
        history: A list of (y, x)-coords representing moves from the initial
            state to the current board state.
        f: The stored value of this node. Used by some search algorithms.
            The value stored here has no meaning if not using a relevant

    A dataclass for returning a puzzle solution along with some information

        The ``unvisited`` and ``visited`` attributes are traditionally known
        as "open" and "closed" in search parlance. However, Python's built-in
